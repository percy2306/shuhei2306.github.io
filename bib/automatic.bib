abstract="As social media has matured, uploading video content has increased. Multiple videos of physical performances, such as dance, are difficult to integrate into high-quality videos without knowledge of video-editing principles. In this study, we present a system that automatically edits dance-performance videos taken from multiple viewpoints into a more attractive and sophisticated dance video. Our system can crop the frame of each camera appropriately by using the performer's behavior and skeleton information. The system determines the camera switches and cut lengths following a probabilistic model of general cinematography guidelines and of knowledge extracted from expert experience. In this study, our system automatically edited a dance video of four performers taken from multiple viewpoints, and ten video-production experts evaluated the generated video. As a result of a comparison of another automatic editing system, our system tended to be performed better.",
